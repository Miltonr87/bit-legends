    longDescription:
      `The Punisher is a 1993 side-scrolling beat ’em up arcade game developed and published by Capcom, based on Marvel’s anti-hero Frank Castle. Players take on the role of The Punisher or Nick Fury (in co-op mode) as they battle through waves of gangsters, ninjas, and cyborgs across gritty urban stages to take down the crime lord Kingpin.\n\n Gameplay combines brutal hand-to-hand combat with explosive firearm action, allowing players to pick up and use guns, knives, pipes, and even environmental objects for creative destruction. Each stage oozes atmosphere — dark alleys, crime dens, and boss arenas filled with destructible scenery — delivering the signature Capcom arcade polish and intensity.\n\nPraised for its fast-paced brawls, fluid animations, and comic-book aesthetic, The Punisher remains one of the most acclaimed arcade titles of the early ‘90s. Its mix of raw violence, stylish presentation, and faithful adaptation of Marvel’s vigilante lore made it a definitive arcade experience for fans of both beat ’em ups and superhero games.`,
